    // Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and
    // use it to sort an array. The Player class is provided in the editor below. It has two fields:
    //      name: a string.
    //      score: an integer.
    // Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score.
    // If 2 or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically ascending by name.
    // To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface,
    // then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2)
    // method. In short, when sorting in ascending order, a comparator function returns -1 if a < b,
    // 1 if a > b, and 0 if a = b.
